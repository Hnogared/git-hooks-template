# Custom commit lint script with install script

To install simply run `bash setup-git-hooks.sh` on your terminal.<br/>
All the hooks inside `.githooks` will be copied into the `.git/hooks/` folder of your local repository.<br/>
<br/>
You can add hooks or modify the already existing one into `.githooks/` and update your local ones by running the bash script again.
